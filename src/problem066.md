# Problem 66 #

OK, we learned in [Problem 64][1] that the centroid of a semicircular arc is \(2 r/ \pi\) from its center. If we spin that semicircular arc around to make a sphere, the centroid will make a circle with arc length \(2\pi (2r/\pi) = 4r\). The arc length of the generating semicircle itself is \(\pi r\), so Pappus's first theorem would tell us that the surface area of the generated sphere is

\[ (\pi r)(4r) = 4 \pi r^2 \]

which is, in fact, what any handbook (or [nice web site][2]) would tell you.
