# Problem 16 #

This is a quick one.

The resultant moment about the center of the drum, which we'll call Point O, is

\[ M_O = 1200 - 1200 \cdot 1 = 0 \]

and the resultant force is simply 1200 lb pointing down. Because the resultant moment about Point O is zero, the line of action of the resultant force must act through that point.
