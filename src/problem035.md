# Problem 35 #

As we've discussed before, the tension in a rope on either side of a frictionless pulley is constant. Therefore, \(T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = T\). To determine the value of *T*, we consider the equilibrium of the floating pulley: the downward force of the weight, *W*, must be balanced by the two upward tension forces. So \(W = 2 T\), and therefore \(T = W/2\). The tackle gives us a mechanical advantage of 2.
