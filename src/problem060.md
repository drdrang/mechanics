# Problem 60 #

I'm sure you can do the integration to find the centroid of the semicircle, but I'm just going to [look it up][1]. It's \(\frac{4r}{3\pi}\) down from the flat edge. Combining this with the triangle, we get

\[ \bar y = \frac{(hr) \cdot \frac{h}{3} - (\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2) \cdot \frac{4r}{3\pi}}{hr + \frac{1}{2}\pi r^2} = \frac{2(h^2 - 2r^2)}{3(2h + \pi r)} \]

We've taken our origin at the center of the semicircle with the *y* axis pointing up. It should go without saying that \(\bar x = 0\).
