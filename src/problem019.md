# Problem 19 #

Because the bar and the pan are in equilibrium when there are no weights, the bar and pan collectively contribute no moment about the balance point and can be left out of our equilibrium equation.

For part a), we take the moments about the balance point, which we'll call O:

\[ \sum M_O = W_1 a - W_2 x = 0 \]

Solving for \(W_1\), we get

\[ W_1 = W_2 \frac{x}{a} \]

For part b), we first note that the maximum capacity will be when \(W_2\) is slid all the way to the left end of the bar. So we use our solution to part a) and substitute in \(x = b = 12\:\rm{in}\), \(a = 1\:\rm{in}\), and \(W_2 = 1\:\rm{lb}\). Thus

\[ W_{1max} = 1\frac{12}{1} = 12\:\rm{lb} \]

In general, for \(a = 1\) and \(W_2 = 1\), 

\[ W_1 = 1 \frac{x}{1} = x \]

where, because I've dropped the units, \(x\) must be measured in inches and \(W_1\) in pounds. We see, then, that the long arm can be marked with a linear scale, every inch representing a pound.
