# Problem 56 #

Because the plate is uniform, the center of gravity is at the centroid of the composite plane shape. The centroid of the square is at \((a/2, a/2)\) and its area is \(a^2\). The centroid of the triangle is at \((4a/3, a/3)\) and its area is \(a^2/2\). (Recall that the centroid of a right triangle is one-third of the leg length from the right angle.)

Combining, we get

\[ \bar x = \frac{a^2 (a/2) + a^2/2 (4a/3)}{a^2 + a^2/2} = \frac{7}{9} a \]

and

\[ \bar y = \frac{a^2 (a/2) + a^2/2 (a/3)}{a^2 + a^2/2} = \frac{4}{9} a \]
