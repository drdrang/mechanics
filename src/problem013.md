# Problem 13 #

This is a great problem for solving with a spreadsheet. Here's one way to lay out the solution.

| Bucket | Angle | Lever arm | Force | Moment   |
|-------:|------:|----------:|------:|---------:|
|     2  |  10.0 |    1.389   |  50   |    69.5  |
|     3  |  32.5 |    4.298   |  75   |   322.4  |
|     4  |  55.0 |    6.553   |  75   |   491.5  |
|     5  |  77.5 |    7.810   |  75   |   585.8  |
|     6  | 100.0 |    7.878   |  50   |   393.9  |
|     7  | 122.5 |    6.747   |  25   |   168.7  |
|        |       |           | Total |  2031.7  |

The lever arm is calculated through the formula \( 8 \cdot \sin \theta \). The answer given in the back of the book is rounded to \( 2032\:\rm{lb}\cdot \rm{ft} \).
