# Problem 58 #

Let's take the horizontal and vertical lines in the drawing in the book to be the *x* and *y* axes, respectively. The equation of the circular boundary, then, is

\[ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \]

This is the radius of the thin disk shown in the drawing. The area of the upper and lower surfaces of the disk is \(\pi x^2 = \pi(r^2 - y^2)\), its thickness is *dy*, and its centroid is *y* from the flat side of the hemisphere. The center of gravity can be calculated through integration:

\[ \bar y = \frac{\int_0^r \pi(r^2 - y^2) y\,dy}{\frac{2}{3}\pi r^3} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \pi r^4}{\frac{2}{3}\pi r^3} = \frac{3}{8} r \]
