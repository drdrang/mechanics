# Problem 32 #

Most textbook problems (including the problems in this book) have "weightless" cables and ropes. There are two reasons for this:

1. It makes the problems less cluttered with detail and the student can concentrate on the principles.
2. The weight of a cable or rope is often very small when compared with the weights it is carrying and taking it to be weightless is then a reasonable approximation.

Here, though, the weight of the rope is essential to the solution of the problem. Because the rope weighs 1 lb/ft, the weight on the left side of the pulley is 10 + *x* + *y* (when *x* and *y* are measured in feet), and the weight on the right side of the pulley is 20 + *x*. These weights must be equal to one another for moment equilibrium about the center of the pulley.

\[ 10 + x + y = 20 + x \]

Notice that the semicircle of rope around the top of the pulley contributes no net moment about the center of the pulley because the left and right quarter-circles balance each other out.

The *x* terms cancel and we are left with \(y = 10\,\rm{ft}\). We can now find *x* from the length of the rope

\[ 20 = 2 x + y + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \pi \cdot 1 \]

Plugging in our value for *y* and solving, we get \(x = 5 - \pi/4 = 4.21\,\rm{ft}\).
